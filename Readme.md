This is a technical test.
For the backend we are going to use DotNet Core's webapi, using EF as ORM and inmemory DB.	
For the frontend we are going to use Angular 7 with rxjs for reactivity and angular-material for ease the design process.	
You are to open the Companies Folder with VS Code and from the command line run "donet run".	
You are to open the Angular folder with VS Code and from the command line run "ng serve".	

To improve:
	Add JWT for all the connections between the frontend and backend.
  	If there are performance issues with the backend, we can change ORM to Dapper or Automapper.
	Dockerize the application, in different containers it wil increase the security of the application.
	We can use guards in angular to check the access to the pages.
	We can use interceptors to handle errors in the http connections, add security token.
